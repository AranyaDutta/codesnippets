# html_css_js_alertbox
A customisable and cool lookin' alertbox preset to save time... <br /><br /><br />
### NOTE: This is basically made on/for django preset(Which can be easily manipulated though)

### Additional Notes:
This icons given need fas-fa icons dependency 
(If the icons don't show up, just add this line to your *html* <head>): <br />
  `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.13.0/css/all.css" integrity="sha384-Bfad6CLCknfcloXFOyFnlgtENryhrpZCe29RTifKEixXQZ38WheV+i/6YWSzkz3V" crossorigin="anonymous" />`
  
  
### How to use with javascript:
  
  Three self explanatory functions: <br />
  `createAlertMessage(tag, message)` *(The only one you need to trigger the alert box)*<br />
  
  <br />
  #### These work automatically hand in hand, you dont need to worry about this for a general case.
  <br />
  
  `closeAlertMessage_TO(alertBox)`<br />
  `closeAlertMessage(alertBoxCLSBTN)`<br />
